Subject: [PATCH] timer: reenable TIMER_ACTIVE timers when restarted

A timer configured with OnActiveSec will start its associated unit again
if the timer is stopped, then started. However, if the timer unit is
restarted -- with "systemctl restart", say -- this does not occur.

This commit ensures that TIMER_ACTIVE timers are re-enabled whenever the
timer is started, even if that's within a restart job.

(cherry picked from commit 779042e772d2459f7649b34a164902dc456f1bab)
