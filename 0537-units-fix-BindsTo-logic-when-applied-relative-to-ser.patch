Subject: [PATCH] units: fix BindsTo= logic when applied relative to services
 with Type=oneshot
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Start jobs for Type=oneshot units are successful when the unit state
transition activating → inactive took place. In such a case all units
that BindsTo= on it previously would continue to run, even though the unit
they dependet on was actually already gone.

(cherry picked from commit ff50244582bf69e8489bba6ce59a21663d7f8274)
